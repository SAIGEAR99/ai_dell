CAUTION: To avoid damaging the components and cards, handle them by their edges, and avoid touching the
pins and the contacts.
CAUTION: When you disconnect a cable, pull it by its connector or its pull tab, not the cable itself. Some cables
have connectors with locking tabs or thumbscrews that you must disengage before disconnecting the cable.
When disconnecting cables, keep them evenly aligned to avoid bending the connector pins. When connecting
cables, ensure that the connector on the cable is correctly oriented and aligned with the port.
CAUTION: Press and eject any installed card from the media-card reader.
CAUTION: Exercise caution when handling rechargeable Li-ion batteries in laptops. Swollen batteries should not
be used and should be replaced and disposed properly.

Safety precautions
This section details the primary steps to be followed before disassembling any device or component.
Observe the following safety precautions before any installation or break-fix procedures involving disassembly or reassembly:
● Turn off the computer and all attached peripherals.
● Disconnect the computer from AC power.
● Disconnect all network cables and peripherals from the computer.
● Use an ESD field service kit when working inside your computer to avoid electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage.
● Place the removed component on an anti-static mat after removing it from the computer.
● Wear shoes with nonconductive rubber soles to reduce the chance of getting electrocuted.
● Press and hold the power button for 15 seconds to discharge the residual power in the system board.
Standby power
Dell products with standby power must be unplugged before you open the back cover. Systems that are equipped with standby
power are powered while turned off. The internal power enables the computer to be remotely turned on (Wake-on-LAN) and
suspended into a sleep mode and has other advanced power management features.
Bonding
Bonding is a method for connecting two or more grounding conductors to the same electrical potential. This is done by using
a field service electrostatic discharge (ESD) kit. When connecting a bonding wire, ensure that it is connected to bare metal
and never to a painted or nonmetal surface. Ensure that the wrist strap is secure and in full contact with your skin. Remove all
jewelry, watches, bracelets, or rings before grounding yourself and the equipment.
Electrostatic discharge—ESD protection
ESD is a major concern when you handle electronic components, especially sensitive components such as expansion cards,
processors, memory modules, and system boards. A slight charge can damage circuits in ways that may not be obvious, such
as intermittent problems or a shortened product life span. As the industry pushes for lower power requirements and increased
density, ESD protection is an increasing concern.
Two recognized types of ESD damage are catastrophic and intermittent failures.
● Catastrophic – Catastrophic failures represent approximately 20 percent of ESD-related failures. The damage causes
an immediate and complete loss of device functionality. An example of catastrophic failure is a memory module that has
34 Working inside your computer

--- PAGE 35 ---
received a static shock and immediately generates a "No POST/No Video" symptom with a beep code that is emitted for
missing or nonfunctional memory.
● Intermittent – Intermittent failures represent approximately 80 percent of ESD-related failures. The high rate of
intermittent failures means that most of the time when damage occurs, it is not immediately recognizable. The memory
module receives a static shock, but the tracing is merely weakened and does not immediately produce outward symptoms
that are related to the damage. The weakened trace may take weeks or months to melt, and in the meantime may cause
degradation of memory integrity, intermittent memory errors, and so on.
Intermittent failures that are also called latent or "walking wounded" are difficult to detect and troubleshoot.
Perform the following steps to prevent ESD damage:
● Use a wired ESD wrist strap that is properly grounded. Wireless anti-static straps do not provide adequate protection.
Touching the chassis before handling parts does not ensure adequate ESD protection on parts with increased sensitivity to
ESD damage.
● Handle all static-sensitive components in a static-safe area. If possible, use anti-static floor pads and workbench pads.
● When unpacking a static-sensitive component from its shipping carton, do not remove the component from the anti-static
packing material until you are ready to install the component. Before unwrapping the anti-static packaging, use the anti-
static wrist strap to discharge the static electricity from your body. For more information about the wrist strap and ESD
wrist strap tester, see Components of an ESD Field Service Kit.
● Before transporting a static-sensitive component, place it in an anti-static container or packaging.
ESD Field Service kit
The unmonitored field service kit is the most commonly used service kit. Each Field Service kit includes three main components:
anti-static mat, wrist strap, and bonding wire.
CAUTION: It is critical to keep ESD-sensitive devices away from internal parts that are insulated and often
highly charged, such as plastic heat sink casings.
Working Environment
Before deploying the ESD Field Service kit, assess the situation at the customer location. For example, deploying the kit for a
server environment is different than for a desktop or laptop environment. Servers are typically installed in a rack within a data
center; desktops or laptops are typically placed on office desks or cubicles. Always look for a large open flat work area that
is free of clutter and large enough to deploy the ESD kit with additional space to accommodate the type of computer that is
being repaired. The workspace should also be free of insulators that can cause an ESD event. On the work area, insulators such
as styrofoam and other plastics should always be moved at least 12 inches or 30 centimeters away from sensitive parts before
physically handling any hardware components.
ESD Packaging
All ESD-sensitive devices must be shipped and received in static-safe packaging. Metal, static-shielded bags are preferred.
However, you should always return the damaged component using the same ESD bag and packaging that the new part arrived
in. The ESD bag should be folded over and taped shut and all the same foam packing material should be used in the original box
that the new part arrived in. ESD-sensitive devices should be removed from packaging only at an ESD-protected work surface,
and parts should never be placed on top of the ESD bag because only the inside of the bag is shielded. Always place parts in
your hand, on the anti-static mat, in the computer, or inside an ESD bag.
Components of an ESD Field Service kit
The components of an ESD Field Service kit are:
● Anti-Static Mat – The anti-static mat is dissipative and parts can be placed on it during service procedures. When using an
anti-static mat, your wrist strap should be snug and the bonding wire should be connected to the anti-static mat and to any
bare metal on the computer being worked on. Once deployed properly, service parts can be removed from the ESD bag and
placed directly on the anti-static mat. ESD-sensitive items are safe in your hand, on the anti-static mat, in the computer, or
inside an ESD bag.
● Wrist Strap and Bonding Wire – The wrist strap and bonding wire can be either directly connected between your wrist
and bare metal on the hardware if the anti-static mat is not required, or connect to the anti-static mat to protect hardware
that is temporarily placed on the mat. The physical connection of the wrist strap and bonding wire between your skin, the
anti-static mat, and the hardware is known as bonding. Use only Field Service kits with a wrist strap, anti-static mat, and
Working inside your computer 35

--- PAGE 36 ---
bonding wire. Never use wireless wrist straps. Always be cautious that the internal wires of a wrist strap are prone to
damage from normal wear and tear, and must be checked regularly with a wrist strap tester in order to avoid accidental ESD
hardware damage. It is recommended to test the wrist strap and bonding wire at least once per week.
● ESD Wrist Strap Tester – The wires inside an ESD strap are prone to damage over time. When using an unmonitored kit, it
is a best practice to regularly test the strap before each service, and at a minimum, test once per week. A wrist strap tester
is the best method for doing this test. To perform the test, plug the bonding-wire of the wrist-strap into the tester while it
is strapped to your wrist and push the button to test. A green LED is lit if the test is successful; a red LED is lit and an alarm
sounds if the test fails.
NOTE: It is recommended to always use the traditional wired ESD grounding wrist strap and protective anti-static mat
when servicing Dell products. In addition, it is critical to keep sensitive parts separate from all insulator parts while servicing
the computer.
Transporting sensitive components
When transporting ESD sensitive components such as replacement parts or parts to be returned to Dell, it is critical to place
these parts in anti-static bags for safe transport.

Passwords
Dell Technologies recommends using the computer password in situations where
it is likely that a computer may be lost or stolen.
M.2 PCIe SSD-0 The hard drive password can be set to prevent unauthorized access of the
data stored on the solid-state drive. The computer prompts for the hard drive
password during boot in order to unlock the drive. A password-secured hard
drive stays locked even when removed from the computer or placed into another
computer. It prevents an attacker from accessing data on the drive without
authorization.
The following rules and dependencies apply when the Hard Drive Password or
M.2 PCIe SSD-0 Password option is used.
● The hard drive password option cannot be accessed when the hard drive is
disabled in the BIOS Setup.
● The computer shuts down when idle for approximately 10 minutes at the hard
drive password prompt.
● The computer shuts down after three incorrect attempts to enter the hard
drive password and treats the hard drive as not available.
● The hard drive does not accept password unlock attempts after five incorrect
attempts to enter the hard drive password from the BIOS Setup. The hard
drive password must be reset for the new password unlock attempts.
● The computer treats the hard drive as not available when the Esc key is
pressed at the hard drive password prompt.
● The hard drive password is not prompted when the computer resumes from
standby mode. When the hard drive is unlocked by the user before the
computer goes into standby mode, it remains unlocked after the computer
resumes from standby mode.
● If the system and hard drive passwords are set to the same value, the hard
drive unlocks after the correct system password is entered.
Dell Technologies recommends using a hard drive password to protect
unauthorized data access.
Password Configuration The Password configuration page includes several options for changing the
requirements of BIOS passwords. You can modify the minimum and maximum
length of the passwords and require passwords to contain certain character
classes (upper case, lower case, digit, special character).
Dell Technologies recommends setting the minimum password length to at least
eight characters.
Password Bypass The Password Bypass option allows the computer to reboot from the operating
system without entering the computer or hard drive password. If the computer
has already booted to the operating system, it is presumed that the user has
already entered the correct computer or hard drive password.
NOTE: This option does not remove the requirement to enter the password
after shutting down.
By default, the Password Bypass option is enabled.
For additional security, Dell Technologies recommends keeping the Password
Bypass option is enabled.

Troubleshooting
Handling swollen rechargeable Li-ion batteries
Like most laptops, Dell laptops use Lithium-ion batteries. One type of Lithium-ion battery is the rechargeable Li-ion battery.
Rechargeable Li-ion batteries have increased in popularity in recent years and have become a standard in the electronics
industry due to customer preferences for a slim form factor (especially with newer ultra-thin laptops) and long battery life.
Inherent to rechargeable Li-ion battery technology is the potential for swelling of the battery cells.
A swollen battery may impact the performance of the laptop. To prevent possible further damage to the device enclosure or
internal components leading to malfunction, discontinue the use of the laptop and discharge it by disconnecting the AC adapter
and letting the battery drain.
Swollen batteries should not be used and must be replaced and disposed of properly. We recommend contacting Dell Support
for options to replace a swollen battery under the terms of the applicable warranty or service contract, including options for
replacement by a Dell authorized service technician.
The guidelines for handling and replacing rechargeable Li-ion batteries are as follows:
● Exercise caution when handling rechargeable Li-ion batteries.
● Discharge the battery before removing it from the laptop. To discharge the battery, unplug the AC adapter from the
computer and operate the computer only on battery power. The battery is fully discharged when the computer no longer
turns on when the power button is pressed.
● Do not crush, drop, mutilate, or penetrate the battery with foreign objects.
● Do not expose the battery to high temperatures, or disassemble battery packs and cells.
● Do not apply pressure to the surface of the battery.
● Do not bend the battery.
● Do not use tools of any type to pry on or against the battery.
● If a battery gets stuck in a device as a result of swelling, do not try to free it as puncturing, bending, or crushing a battery
can be dangerous.
● Do not attempt to reassemble a damaged or swollen battery into a laptop.
● Swollen batteries that are covered under warranty should be returned to Dell in an approved shipping container (provided
by Dell)—this is to comply with transportation regulations. Swollen batteries that are not covered under warranty should
be disposed of at an approved recycling center. Contact Dell Support at Dell Support Site for assistance and further
instructions.
● Using a non-Dell or incompatible battery may increase the risk of fire or explosion. Replace the battery only with a
compatible battery purchased from Dell that is designed to work with your Dell computer. Do not use a battery from other
computers with your computer. Always purchase genuine batteries from Dell Site or otherwise directly from Dell.
Rechargeable Li-ion batteries can swell for various reasons such as age, number of charge cycles, or exposure to high heat. For
more information about how to improve the performance and lifespan of the laptop battery and to minimize the possibility of
occurrence of the issue, search Dell laptop battery in the Knowledge Base Resource at Dell Support Site.

Built-in self-test (BIST)
Motherboard Built-In Self-Test (M-BIST)
M-BIST is the system board onboard self-test diagnostics tool that improves the diagnostics accuracy of system board
Embedded Controller (EC) failures.
NOTE: M-BIST can be manually initiated before Power On Self-Test (POST).
How to run M-BIST
NOTE: Before initiating M-BIST, ensure that the computer is in a power-off state.
1. Press and hold both the M key and the power button to initiate M-BIST.
2. The battery indicator LED may exhibit two states:
● Off: No fault was detected.
● Amber and White: Indicates a problem with the system board.
3. If there is a failure with the system board, the battery status LED flashes one of the following error codes for 30 seconds:
Table 52. LED error codes
Blinking Pattern Possible Problem
Amber White
2 1 CPU Failure
2 8 LCD Power Rail Failure
1 1 TPM Detection Failure
2 4 Memory/RAM failure
4. If there is no failure with the system board, the LCD cycles through the solid color screens (that are described in the
LCD-BIST) for 30 seconds and then turn off.

Logic Built-in Self-test (L-BIST)
L-BIST is an enhancement to the single LED error code diagnostics and is automatically initiated during POST. L-BIST will check
the LCD power rail. If there is no power being supplied to the LCD (that is if the L-BIST circuit fails), the battery status LED
flashes either an error code [2,8] or an error code [2,7].
NOTE: If L-BIST fails, LCD-BIST cannot function as no power will be supplied to the LCD.
How to invoke the L-BIST
1. Turn on your computer.
2. If the computer does not start up normally, look at the battery status LED:
● If the battery status LED flashes an error code [2,7], the display cable may not be connected properly.
● If the battery status LED flashes an error code [2,8], there is a failure on the LCD power rail of the system board, hence
there is no power that is supplied to the LCD.
3. For cases, when a [2,7] error code is shown, check to see if the display cable is properly connected.
4. For cases when a [2,8] error code is shown, replace the system board.
LCD Built-in Self-Test (LCD-BIST)
Dell laptops have a built-in diagnostic tool that helps you determine if the screen abnormality you are experiencing is an inherent
problem with the LCD (screen) of the Dell laptop or with the video card (GPU) and computer settings.
When you notice screen abnormalities like flickering, distortion, clarity issues, fuzzy or blurry image, horizontal or vertical lines,
color fade, it is always a good practice to isolate the LCD (screen) by running the LCD-BIST.
How to invoke the LCD-BIST
1. Turn off your computer.
2. Disconnect any peripherals that are connected to the computer. Connect only the AC adapter (charger) to the computer.
3. Ensure that the LCD (screen) is clean (no dust particles on the surface of the screen).
4. Press and hold the D key and press the power button to enter LCD-BIST mode. Continue to hold the D key until the
computer boots up.
5. The screen displays solid colors and changes colors on the entire screen to white, black, red, green, and blue twice.
6. Then it displays the colors white, black, and red.
7. Carefully inspect the screen for abnormalities (any lines, fuzzy color, or distortion on the screen).
8. At the end of the last solid color (red), the computer shuts down.
NOTE: Dell SupportAssist Preboot diagnostics upon launch initiates an LCD-BIST first, expecting a user intervention to
confirm functionality of the LCD.
System-diagnostic lights
This section lists the system-diagnostic lights of your Dell Pro 16 PC16250.
The following table shows different Service LED blinking patterns and associated problems. The diagnostic light codes consist of
a two-digit number, and the digits are separated by a comma. The number stands for a blinking pattern; the first digit shows the
number of blinks in amber color, and the second digit shows the number of blinks in white color. The Service LED blinks in the
following manner:
● The Service LED blinks the number of times equal to the value of the first digit and turns off with a short pause.
● After that, the Service LED blinks the number of times equal to the value of the second digit.
● The Service LED turns off again with a longer pause.
● After the second pause, the blinking pattern will be repeated.
